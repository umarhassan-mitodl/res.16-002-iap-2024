*Below, Andy G. Eskenazi describes what motivated students to sign up for the workshop "How to CAD Almost Anything."*

In the sign-up form for the course, I asked students to briefly describe why they were interested in learning how to CAD. The responses that I received were extremely varied, and included building a project portfolio; learning or becoming more proficient in a CAD software, for use in research, fabrication, extracurricular clubs,or personal projects; learning to render 3D objects; learning about 3D visualization and the design process in general; and perhaps most fundamentally, being able to take any object and produce a 3D model out of it!
