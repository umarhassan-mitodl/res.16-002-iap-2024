## Curriculum Information

### Prerequisites

None, except "willingness to have fun and think outside the box!" (to quote the workshop syllabus).

### Requirements Satisfied

None.

### Offered

"How to CAD Almost Anything" was taught for the first time in the Independent Activities Period of 2024.

## Student Information

### Enrollment

130, including 2 alumni and 2 community members

### Student Background

Due to classroom space limitations, only approximately 35â€“40 students attended in person; the rest joined remotely or watched the course videos asynchronously. Of the in-person students, 10 different majors were represented: Aeronautics and Astronautics (15%), Architecture (3%), Chemical Engineering (5%), Materials Science and Engineering (3%), Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (18%), Math (3%), Mechanical Engineering (44%), Nuclear Engineering (3%), and System Design and Management (3%). These students hailed from 6 different countries (the United States, Canada, Germany, India, Japan, and Sweden) and 13 states and territories (California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Puerto Rico, Texas, and Vermont).

About 60% of the enrolled students had not heard of CAD before or had a very limited prior experience with any CAD software.

## How Student Time Was Spent

### Lectures

The workshop took place over the course of nine two-hour sessions.

### Out of Class

Outside of class, students practiced CAD skills in SolidWorks and worked to build a comprehensive design portfolio, in the form of a presentation showcasing the different in-class projects and CAD skills they had mastered.
